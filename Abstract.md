The project revolves around developing a cross-platform mobile application tailored for University College Cork's (UCC) clubs and societies. It serves as a centralized hub offering features such as media sharing, post interaction, event management, live streaming, membership control, notifications, club discovery/recommendations for students and chat functionality. Targeting students and club administrators, the app aims to boost engagement and streamline operations within UCC's extracurricular landscape.

The current methods of club discovery, primarily through physical events like club days, are considered outdated and inefficient. This absence of a centralized platform hampers engagement and operational efficiency within the university's extracurricular ecosystem. Without such a platform, many clubs and societies struggle to gain visibility among students. This lack of exposure can hinder their ability to attract new members and promote their activities effectively. As a result, some clubs may face stagnation or even dissolution due to low participation rates.
